// INHERITANCE
/*
1. When the base class specifier is public, the access status of the inherited members remains unchanged. Thus, inherited public members are public, and inherited protected members are protected in a derived class. 
2. When the base class specifier is protected, both public and protected members of a base class are inherited as protected members. 
3. When the base class specifier is private, inherited public and protected members become private to the derived class, so they’re accessible by member functions of the derived class but cannot be accessed if they’re inherited in another derived class.
