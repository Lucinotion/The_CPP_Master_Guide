    ABSTRACT CLASS / PURELY VIRTUAL CLASS
*/
// This classes contain at least one virtual method (a method with no implementation)
// This means that you cannot make a object out of this class
// But other classes can inherit from this class, and you can make a pointer from this class and then point it to a child that inherits it.

// BOXING
// Boxing is a concept introduced by polymorphism
// This means that you can have methods that only operate with the base class so that:
// You can cast the child into the base class (boxing), operate with them in the functions that only accept base objects, and then cast them back (unboxing).
